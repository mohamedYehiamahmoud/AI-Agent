Building AI Agents using Ollama and Crewi ai (llama3)

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use CrewAI to generate a comprehensive roadmap for beginners in Data Science. The notebook leverages the power of AI agents to create a structured learning path.
Prerequisites
Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
CrewAI
LangChain
Ollama

Installation
To install the required packages, run:
bashCopypip install crewai langchain-community jupyter
You'll also need to install Ollama separately. Follow the instructions on the Ollama website.[# CrewAI Data Science Roadmap Generator

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use CrewAI to generate a comprehensive roadmap for beginners in Data Science. The notebook leverages the power of AI agents to create a structured learning path.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- CrewAI
- LangChain
- Ollama

## Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install crewai langchain-community jupyter
```

You'll also need to install Ollama separately. Follow the instructions on the [Ollama website](https://ollama.ai/).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the Jupyter notebook.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell in order.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook consists of the following main sections:

1. Importing required libraries
2. Setting up the Ollama language model
3. Defining AI agents (Mentor and Tech Content Strategist)
4. Creating tasks for the agents
5. Setting up the CrewAI workflow
6. Executing the workflow and generating the roadmap

## Key Components

### Agents

- **Mentor**: Gathers relevant information about the Data Science roadmap.
- **Tech Content Strategist**: Crafts compelling content based on the information provided by the Mentor.

### Tasks

- **Gather Info**: Collects information about the Data Science roadmap for beginners.
- **Write Prompt**: Uses the gathered information to create a structured roadmap.

### CrewAI Workflow

The notebook sets up a sequential process where the Mentor agent first gathers information, and then the Tech Content Strategist uses that information to create the final roadmap.

## Output

The notebook generates a comprehensive Data Science roadmap for beginners, including:

- Foundational knowledge
- Data preprocessing skills
- Machine learning fundamentals
- Advanced topics and specializations
- Practical experience and projects

## Customization

You can modify the `topic` variable to generate roadmaps for different subjects or adjust the agents' roles and goals to suit your specific needs.
